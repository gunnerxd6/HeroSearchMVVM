# HeroesSearch!

This is an android application created to serve as part of my mobile application portfolio.
This app allows you to search for comics heroes in an api (https://superheroapi.com) and display it in a list with some information and an image of the character.

# Features
- **MVVM**: This app uses MVVM as architectural pattern to separate in a well organized way the app in layers.
- **JetPack Compose**: The new way to create interfaces for android that replaces the old xml model

# Todos
- Add dependency injection
- Handle unexpected responses from api
- Add navigation to show additional screens
- Mark favorites heroes and save into a local database
